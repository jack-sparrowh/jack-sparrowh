- 👋 Hi, I’m @jack-sparrowh,
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning,
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mathematics (calculus), linear algebra, statistics, python and ML libraries, and a way of working and thinking in the world of data science,
- 💞️ I’m looking to get some working experience (internship), as it would speed up the learning process of getting better each day.
